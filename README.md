**Smart Keyword Suggest** is a Visual Studio Code extension that detects **typos in language keywords and variable names** for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Java. It provides **inline suggestions, strikethrough highlighting**, and **quick fixes** to improve code quality and reduce bugs.

---

## Features

- ✅ Supports **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, JSX, and TSX**.
- ✅ Detects **typos in keywords and variables**.
- ✅ Highlights errors with **red strikethrough decorations**.
- ✅ Suggests **nearest correct keywords or symbols** using Levenshtein distance.
- ✅ Tracks **in-scope variables and symbols** for accurate suggestions.
- ✅ **Per-range suggestions**: Same word at different positions gets different suggestions based on local scope.
- ✅ **Diagnostic-first suggestions**: TS/ESLint suggestions appear first, followed by extension suggestions.
- ✅ **Max 3 suggestions per range** to keep CodeLens clean and focused.
- ✅ Provides **inline CodeLens suggestions** to quickly replace typos.
- ✅ Commands:
  - `Fix Typo` – Instantly replace a typo.
  - `Refresh Suggestions` – Refresh CodeLens and diagnostics manually.
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl+Alt+F` → Fix typo.
  - `Ctrl+Alt+R` → Refresh suggestions.
- ✅ Debounced updates for **fast perceived response**.
- ✅ Symbol caching for performance in **large files**.
- ✅ **Centralized logging** with `[smart-keyword-suggest]` prefix for easy filtering.

## Installation

1. Install from VSCode Marketplace or load the extension from VSIX.
2. Open a supported language file mentioned in features.
3. Ensure TypeScript checking (`checkJs`) is enabled for JavaScript/TypeScript for undeclared variable detection (optional).

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "target": "ES2020"
  },
  "include": ["**/*.js", "**/*.ts", "**/*.jsx", "**/*.tsx"]
}
```

---

## Usage

1. **Typo Detection:**

   - Misspelled keywords or undeclared variables are automatically highlighted with **red strikethrough**.
   - Hover or click **CodeLens** to see replacement suggestions.

2. **Fixing Typos:**

   - Click a CodeLens suggestion to replace the typo.
   - Strikethrough decoration and CodeLens update immediately.

3. **Manual Refresh:**

   - Run `Refresh Keyword Suggestions` from the Command Palette or press `Ctrl+Alt+R` to manually refresh suggestions and decorations.

4. **Scope-Aware Suggestions:**

   - The same word at different positions in your code receives tailored suggestions based on the local scope.
   - Example: `timere` at line 5 might suggest `timer` based on scope A, while `timere` at line 15 might suggest `tmer` based on scope B.

---

## Configuration

No extra configuration is needed. Optional:

- Add custom keywords to the `keywords` array in the extension source.
- Adjust debounce delay for perceived speed in `extension.ts`.

---

## Example

```javascript
functon greet(name) {
  consol.log("Hello " + name); // ❌ 'functon' and 'consol' highlighted
}

let timere = "test"; // ❌ 'timere' highlighted
```

- Suggestions:

  - Replace `'functon'` → `'function'`.
  - Replace `'consol'` → `'console'`.
  - Replace `'timere'` → `'timer'` (primary from diagnostic) + `'tmer'`, `'texttimer'` (similar candidates, max 3 total).

---

## Tech Stack

- VSCode Extension API
- TypeScript & JavaScript
- Levenshtein distance (`fast-levenshtein`)
- Regex & CodeLens for inline suggestions
- Symbol caching and debounced updates for performance
- Centralized logger with prefixed output for filtering

## What's New in v0.2.3

- **Per-Range Scope-Aware Suggestions**: Same word at different positions now receives different suggestions based on local scope.
- **Merged Diagnostics**: Multiple diagnostics for the same word and range are merged with deduplicated suggestions.
- **Diagnostic-First Ordering**: TS/ESLint suggestions appear first in CodeLens, followed by extension suggestions.
- **Max 3 Suggestions**: CodeLens now shows at most 3 suggestions per range to keep the editor clean.
- **JSX/TSX Support**: Special handling for JSX and TSX files with improved parse error filtering.
- **Centralized Logging**: All console logs use the `[smart-keyword-suggest]` prefix for easy filtering in the extension host output.

---

## Known Limitations

- Best used with **plain files** and modern language modules.
- Undeclared variable detection depends on TypeScript or ESLint configuration.
- Cross-file variable tracking is not yet supported.
